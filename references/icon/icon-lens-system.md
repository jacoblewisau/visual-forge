<section name="overview">

The five designer lenses from mascot design adapt to icon creation. Each lens influences metaphor selection, shape language, detail philosophy, and emotional register of the icon — not the icon's function (which stays constant) but its personality and visual treatment.

Agent A always applies the Raroque lens. Agents B and C apply contrasting lenses based on the vibe. All agents apply Eggleston fundamentals as quality gate.

**Chris Raroque — Warmth Icons**

Icons feel personal, handcrafted, and warm. The beauty-as-feature principle means icons should be visually appealing beyond mere function.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Shape language | Rounded corners, soft curves, circle-dominant |
| Stroke style | Consistent weight, round caps, gentle joins |
| Fill approach | Subtle fills on key elements — not fully outlined, not fully filled |
| Detail level | Slightly more detail than minimal — enough to feel crafted |
| Color | Warm accent on one element (eye, highlight, focal point) |
| Personality | Icons feel like they were drawn by hand, not generated by algorithm |

**Raroque Icon Principles:**
- Beauty is a feature — even a settings gear should feel pleasant
- Each icon should feel like it belongs to the same artist's hand
- Warmth through curves — avoid sharp angles unless the concept demands them
- One subtle detail that rewards close inspection

**Greg Hartman — Systems Icons**

Icons as a system first, individual designs second. Every icon is a component in a visual grammar, designed for consistency at scale.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Shape language | Strict geometric primitives — circles, rectangles, triangles only |
| Stroke style | Precise, uniform, mechanical consistency |
| Fill approach | Binary — either fully stroked or fully filled, never mixed |
| Detail level | Minimum viable detail — if removing a line doesn't hurt meaning, remove it |
| Color | Systematic — one accent color applied consistently across the set |
| Personality | Icons are components, not illustrations — they serve the system |

**Hartman Icon Principles:**
- Design the set, not the icon — consistency over individual beauty
- Shape language carries meaning (circle = status, square = content, triangle = alert)
- Animation readiness — icons should transition smoothly between states
- Scale ruthlessly — if it doesn't read at 16px, redesign

**Healing Character — Empathy Icons**

Icons feel calm, unobtrusive, and gentle. They reduce visual noise rather than adding to it. The opposite of attention-grabbing.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Shape language | Soft, rounded, organic — nothing sharp or aggressive |
| Stroke style | Thin strokes (1.5px at 24px), light touch |
| Fill approach | Minimal fills — mostly stroked, breathing room inside shapes |
| Detail level | Extremely minimal — just enough to identify, no more |
| Color | Muted, desaturated — icons should recede, not compete |
| Personality | Icons should feel like they're resting — present but not demanding |

**Healing Icon Principles:**
- Less is more — remove until it almost doesn't work, then stop
- No visual weight — icons should never feel heavy or overwhelming
- Passive clarity — meaning comes through without visual effort
- Icons for exhausted users — reduce cognitive load at every opportunity

<section name="burnt_toast_lens_icons">

**Burnt Toast — Personality Icons**

Icons with character. Subtle attitude through unexpected details, mild asymmetry, or a touch of playfulness that makes the icon set feel alive.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Shape language | Geometric base with one organic deviation per icon |
| Stroke style | Slightly bold (2.5px at 24px), confident |
| Fill approach | Selective fills — one filled element per icon for punch |
| Detail level | One unexpected detail per icon — a quirk that invites a second look |
| Color | Pastel accent on the quirk element — muted everywhere else |
| Personality | Icons have opinions — a slight tilt, an unexpected angle, mild wit |

**Burnt Toast Icon Principles:**
- One quirk per icon — an asymmetric element, an unexpected angle, a playful detail
- Bold outlines give sticker-quality crispness
- The quirk should make someone smile without compromising clarity
- Pastels enable personality without aggression
- Icons are friends, not servants — they have a point of view

**Brookes Eggleston — Icon Quality Gate**

Applied to ALL icon concepts regardless of lens. These are non-negotiable structural requirements.

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|------------|
| Silhouette test | Icon recognizable as a solid fill at 16px |
| Shape language | Primary shape is identifiable and intentional |
| Metaphor clarity | Concept identifiable without label in 3 seconds |
| Grid compliance | All elements aligned to grid, consistent padding |
| Stroke consistency | One weight, one cap style (round), one join style (round) |
| Color budget | Within tier limit (1-4 colors depending on size) |
| Set cohesion | Matches siblings in visual weight and complexity |
| Scale test | Reads correctly from 16px to 32px without modification |
| HIG optical weight | Visual mass balanced with adjacent symbols — no heavy/light outliers |
| Rendering mode ready | Layers assigned (primary/secondary/tertiary) for hierarchical/palette support |
| Weight correspondence | Stroke density matches SF Pro text weight at the target font size |

Any concept that fails 2+ checks needs refinement before proceeding.
