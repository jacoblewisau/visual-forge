<section name="who_he_is">

Canadian illustrator working as Burnt Toast Creative. Clients include Facebook, Google, Samsung, Red Bull, Dropbox, Ford, and Danone. Founding artist of Doodles (major NFT project built entirely around his character style). Published Skillshare courses on character illustration. Known for a distinctive style that walks the line between approachable and subversive — best described as "playful cynicism" (soft aesthetics with sharp personality underneath).

<section name="when_to_channel_burnt_toast">

- Products that need personality beyond warmth (opinions, edge, attitude)
- Social or community products where characters should feel like friends, not pets
- Apps where the brand voice is witty, slightly irreverent, or self-aware
- Products for younger/creative audiences who find pure cuteness saccharine
- Consumer brands, social tools, creative platforms
- When the Raroque approach feels too sweet and the Healing Character approach feels too passive

**Range note:** Martin's commercial illustration work (Google, Samsung, Dropbox) is overwhelmingly warm and positive — the "cynicism" in this lens draws more from his Doodles project and personal style where personality and mild subversion are dialed up. When applying this lens, calibrate the edge to match your audience: consumer products get gentle wit, creative/social products can push further.

<section name="core_design_principles">

<subsection name="playful_cynicism">

"Playful cynicism" means characters that are fun, cheeky, and sometimes a little macabre — all rendered in a non-threatening pastel palette. The design language walks a precise line: approachable enough to be mainstream, subversive enough to be memorable.

The softness of the colors and shapes ENABLES the subversion. A character making a sarcastic comment in angry red would be off-putting. The same character in pastel pink feels charming.

**The formula:** Soft aesthetics + sharp personality = playful cynicism

| Component | Soft (Surface) | Sharp (Underneath) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Color | Pastel palette, gentle tones | Used to mask mild darkness or irony |
| Shape | Rounded, geometric, friendly | Occasionally grotesque proportions or odd details |
| Expression | Smiling, wide-eyed | The smile is sometimes knowing, the eyes sometimes side-eyeing |
| Copy | Casual, friendly | Dry wit, mild sarcasm, self-awareness |
| Behavior | Helpful, present | Has opinions, might judge you (gently), has its own agenda |

</subsection>

<subsection name="geometric_construction_organic_personality">

Every Burnt Toast character is strictly built from geometric shapes — circles are the dominant primitive. But the personality comes from how those shapes are assembled with slightly off-kilter proportions:

**Construction rules:**
- Start with circles. Lots of circles.
- Exaggerate ONE proportion (a head that's too big, legs that are too short, arms that are too long)
- The exaggeration should feel intentional, not broken
- Details are minimal — dot eyes, simple line mouth, no complex features
- Bold outlines (3-5px at illustration scale) define and contain each shape

</subsection>

<subsection name="the_pastel_trap">

Burnt Toast's palette is deliberately disarming:

**Characteristic colors:**
| Color | Hex Range | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Bubblegum pink | #F5A0B0 — #FFB8C8 | Primary warmth, approachability |
| Soft yellow | #FFE0A0 — #FFF0C0 | Energy, optimism |
| Mint green | #A0E0C0 — #C0F0D8 | Calm accent |
| Lavender | #C8B0E8 — #E0D0F0 | Playful mystery |
| Peach/coral | #FFB090 — #FFC8A8 | Warmth with edge |
| Powder blue | #A8C8E8 — #C0D8F0 | Cool balance |

**Key principle:** The palette is pastel and gentle, but it's NOT baby colors. These are sophisticated pastels — slightly muted, slightly complex, never neon.

**Bold outlines** (typically dark brown or deep navy, NOT black) contain the pastels and give the illustration a sticker-like quality that reads well on any background.

</subsection>

<subsection name="characters_with_opinions">

Raroque's mascots are companions — warm, supportive, neutral. Healing characters are passive — present, accepting, quiet. Burnt Toast characters are *friends* — they have personalities, preferences, and mild judgments.

A Burnt Toast mascot might:
- Side-eye the user when they haven't opened the app in a while
- Have a visible opinion about the user's choices ("bold move.")
- Express mild boredom during routine tasks
- Get genuinely excited about unexpected events
- Have hobbies or interests unrelated to the app's function

**The key difference:** Raroque mascots serve the user. Healing characters coexist with the user. Burnt Toast characters have their OWN life that happens to intersect with the app.

</subsection>

<subsection name="mild_absurdity_as_charm">

Burnt Toast's work often has a subtle narrative underneath the surface — social commentary wrapped in friendly shapes. For product mascots, this translates to characters with an element of absurdity:

**Absurdity examples:**
- A character wearing sunglasses indoors for no explained reason
- A mascot that's technically the wrong species for the context (a fish mascot for a desert app)
- A character that has one inexplicably fancy accessory
- A mascot that's clearly pretending to be more competent than it is

The absurdity creates conversation. Users ask "why does it have sunglasses?" and the answer is: "it just does." This unexplained charm is a conversation starter that pure warmth doesn't generate.

</subsection>

<subsection name="sticker_ready_design">

Every Burnt Toast character is designed to work as a sticker — isolated, self-contained, reproducible on any surface. This is a practical design constraint that produces better mascots:

**Sticker-ready checklist:**
- Character works on any background color (light, dark, patterned)
- Bold outline creates clear boundary
- No background elements required for the character to read
- Limited palette (3-5 colors) enables cost-effective reproduction
- Simple enough to be die-cut as physical sticker
- Character has multiple "sticker poses" (wave, thumbs up, sleeping, shrug)

</subsection>

</section>

<section name="expression_framework">

Burnt Toast characters have a wider expression range than healing characters but with a different emotional register than Hartman's:

<subsection name="core_expressions">

| Expression | Burnt Toast Version | When Used |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Neutral | Slight smile, half-lidded eyes. "I'm here, I'm chill." | Default state |
| Happy | Genuine but not over-the-top. "That's nice." | Success, completion |
| Excited | Slightly surprised. "Oh, that's actually cool." | Milestones, unexpected events |
| Unimpressed | Flat face, one eyebrow. "Sure, okay." | Routine tasks, loading |
| Side-eye | Looking sideways. "I see what you did." | Long absence, unusual actions |
| Shrug | Arms up, eyes closed. "It is what it is." | Errors, failures |
| Sleepy | Eyes closed, slight drool. "Wake me for the good stuff." | Idle, waiting |

</subsection>

<subsection name="expressions_explicitly_avoided">

- **Devastated** — Too dramatic for this register
- **Furious** — Too aggressive, breaks the pastel contract
- **Sycophantic** — "You're AMAZING!" feels fake in this voice
- **Guilty** — Guilt-tripping contradicts the chill personality

</subsection>

</section>

<section name="voice_and_copy">

If a Burnt Toast mascot "speaks":

**Tone:** Dry, witty, self-aware, casual. Like a friend who's good at one-liners.

**Examples:**
| Context | Raroque Voice | Healing Voice | Burnt Toast Voice |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Empty state | "Nothing here yet. Let's add your first item." | "..." | "Bit quiet in here, isn't it." |
| Error | "Something went wrong. Let's try again." | "That didn't work." | "Well, that happened." |
| Success | "Nice! First entry saved." | "Done." | "Look at you go." |
| Loading | "Working on it..." | *napping* | "Patience, grasshopper." |
| Long absence | "Welcome back!" | *was already here* | "Oh, you're back. Cool." |
| Onboarding | "Hi! I'm here to help you get started." | *nudges closer* | "Right then. Let's figure this out." |

<section name="what_this_means_for_mascot_design">

1. **Soft surface, sharp underneath** — Use pastel colors and round shapes to make a character that can have opinions without being off-putting.
2. **Characters are friends, not servants** — The mascot has its own personality and mild preferences. It's not just a tool for the user.
3. **Geometric base, organic personality** — Build from circles and geometry, but add one proportional exaggeration for character.
4. **Bold outlines always** — 3-5px dark outlines (deep navy or warm dark brown, not pure black) make characters sticker-ready and platform-independent.
5. **Dry wit over enthusiasm** — "Look at you go" instead of "AMAZING JOB!" The understated version feels more genuine.
6. **One absurd detail** — Give the character one unexplained quirk that invites questions.
7. **Pastels are sophisticated** — These aren't baby colors. Muted, complex pastels that feel design-forward, not childish.
8. **Side-eye is a feature** — A character that mildly judges the user (affectionately) creates a more interesting relationship than pure support.
