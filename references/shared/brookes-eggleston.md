<section name="when_to_channel_eggleston">

- When you need rigorous character design FUNDAMENTALS applied to any concept
- When a concept from another designer lens needs structural validation
- When a character doesn't "read" well and needs shape language analysis
- When evaluating why a mascot concept feels weak or forgettable
- When designing for animation, games, or contexts requiring strong silhouettes
- As a quality-check layer applied AFTER another lens generates the concept

<section name="core_framework_the_6_elements">

Eggleston codifies character design into teachable, repeatable elements. Where Raroque works from intuition and personal warmth, Eggleston provides the underlying grammar that makes intuitive designs actually work.

<subsection name="1_shape_language">

The most fundamental tool. Every character is built from a primary shape that communicates personality before any detail is added.

**The Three Primitives:**

| Shape | Communicates | Associated Traits | Use For |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Circle** | Safety, friendliness, approachability, softness | Warm, gentle, playful, innocent | Friendly mascots, children's products, companion characters |
| **Square** | Stability, reliability, strength, trustworthiness | Dependable, sturdy, grounded, professional | Enterprise mascots, security products, foundation characters |
| **Triangle** | Danger, energy, dynamism, intelligence | Sharp, cunning, fast, aggressive | Villain characters, alert states, action-oriented products |

**Compound shapes** combine primaries:
- Circle + square = friendly AND reliable (ideal for most product mascots)
- Circle + triangle = playful but sharp (good for creative/dev tools)
- Square + triangle = strong and dynamic (good for productivity/performance)

**Application rule:** Choose the primary shape FIRST, then design the character to embody it. If you start with species and try to force a shape, the design will feel inconsistent.

</subsection>

<subsection name="2_silhouette">

A character's silhouette is its most reduced form — the shape you see when the character is entirely black. A strong silhouette is:

**Instantly recognizable** — You can identify the character from silhouette alone
**Unique** — It doesn't look like any other character in the same context
**Readable at any size** — The key features are apparent even at 16px
**Action-communicating** — The silhouette suggests what the character is doing/feeling

**The Silhouette Test:**
1. Fill the character entirely black
2. Show it to someone for 2 seconds
3. Can they tell you: (a) what species it is, (b) what it's doing, (c) its general mood?
4. If not, the silhouette needs more distinction

**Common silhouette failures:**
- Head and body are the same width (blobby, no distinction)
- No asymmetric elements (too generic)
- Key features (ears, tail, crest) don't extend beyond the main body mass
- At small sizes, collapses into a circle or rectangle

**Fix:** Add ONE exaggerated feature that breaks the basic mass — oversized ears, a distinctive tail, a crest, an unusual body proportion. This single breakout element IS the character's visual identity.

</subsection>

<subsection name="3_proportion">

How body parts relate to each other communicates age, personality, and role:

| Proportion | Effect | Use For |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Large head, small body | Childlike, cute, vulnerable | Friendly mascots, kawaii style |
| Equal head and body | Balanced, mature but approachable | Professional-but-friendly mascots |
| Small head, large body | Powerful, imposing, physical | Strength/security mascots |
| Large eyes relative to face | Expressive, emotional, appealing | Any mascot that needs emotional range |
| Small eyes relative to face | Mysterious, serious, stoic | Enterprise, security, minimal mascots |

**The "Appeal" proportion:** For product mascots, the optimal starting point is a head that's 40-60% of total height, with eyes that are 25-40% of the face. This creates inherent appeal through the "baby schema" (Kindchenschema) — humans are wired to find large-headed, large-eyed creatures endearing.

</subsection>

<subsection name="4_personality_mapping">

Translate abstract personality traits into concrete visual decisions:

**Step 1:** Define 3 personality traits (functional, emotional, distinctive)
**Step 2:** For each trait, identify visual correlates:

| Trait | Visual Expression |
|-------|------------------|
| Energetic | Asymmetric pose, wide eyes, dynamic silhouette |
| Calm | Symmetric pose, half-closed eyes, grounded stance |
| Precise | Sharp details, clean lines, geometric forms |
| Messy | Loose lines, asymmetric features, organic shapes |
| Warm | Round shapes, warm colors, soft edges |
| Cool | Angular shapes, cool colors, crisp edges |
| Playful | Exaggerated proportions, bright colors, off-center balance |
| Serious | Realistic proportions, muted colors, centered balance |
| Mysterious | Obscured features, dark values, unusual forms |
| Transparent | Clear features, bright values, simple forms |

**Step 3:** Check for conflicts — if trait A demands circles but trait B demands triangles, one must dominate. The primary shape should match the dominant trait.

</subsection>

<subsection name="5_color_theory_for_characters">

Color is not just aesthetic — it communicates personality:

**Temperature:**
- Warm colors (red, orange, yellow) → Energetic, passionate, urgent
- Cool colors (blue, green, purple) → Calm, trustworthy, mysterious
- Neutral (gray, brown, cream) → Grounded, reliable, unassuming

**Saturation:**
- High saturation → Young, energetic, attention-grabbing
- Medium saturation → Balanced, professional, approachable
- Low saturation → Mature, subtle, sophisticated

**Value contrast:**
- High contrast (light + dark) → Dynamic, bold, visible
- Low contrast (similar values) → Gentle, subtle, cohesive

**Color count rule:** Product mascots should use 3-5 colors maximum. Each additional color makes the character harder to recognize, harder to reproduce, and harder to animate.

</subsection>

<subsection name="6_gesture_and_pose">

How a character holds itself communicates personality instantly:

**Line of Action:** Every pose should have a single dominant curve (the "line of action") that flows through the character's body. This line communicates energy:
- Straight line = rigid, alert, formal
- Gentle curve = relaxed, approachable, friendly
- Dramatic curve = dynamic, energetic, dramatic
- S-curve = graceful, flowing, elegant

**Default pose:** The character's resting pose should communicate its personality without any context:
- Standing tall, chest out = confident, proud
- Slight lean forward = curious, engaged
- Slouching or sitting = relaxed, casual
- Arms crossed = defensive or cool
- Hands behind back = polite, helpful
- One hand up = welcoming, greeting

</subsection>

</section>

<section name="the_quality_checklist">

Apply this checklist to ANY mascot concept, regardless of which designer lens generated it:

<subsection name="does_it_pass">

- [ ] **Shape language is clear** — You can identify the primary shape (circle/square/triangle)
- [ ] **Silhouette is unique** — Black fill is recognizable and distinct from other characters
- [ ] **Proportions match personality** — Head/body ratio communicates the right age/energy
- [ ] **3 traits are visually expressed** — Each personality trait has a concrete visual correlate
- [ ] **Color budget is respected** — 3-5 colors maximum
- [ ] **Default pose communicates** — The resting state tells you who this character is
- [ ] **Scale works** — Recognizable from 16px to 1024px
- [ ] **Simplification path exists** — You can describe how to reduce detail at each size step

</subsection>

<subsection name="common_failures">

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "It looks generic" | No dominant shape language | Commit to ONE primary shape and exaggerate it |
| "It doesn't read at small sizes" | Too much detail, weak silhouette | Add one exaggerated breakout feature |
| "It feels childish" | Head too large, eyes too big | Reduce head to 40% of height, add one mature detail |
| "It feels corporate" | Too geometric, no organic elements | Add one asymmetric or organic detail |
| "I can't tell what it's feeling" | Eyes too small or too uniform | Enlarge eyes to 30%+ of face, add eyelid variation |
| "It doesn't fit the brand" | Shape language contradicts brand values | Realign primary shape with brand personality |

</subsection>

</section>

<section name="what_this_means_for_mascot_design">

1. **Shape first, species second** — Decide circle/square/triangle before choosing what creature it is.
2. **Silhouette test everything** — If it doesn't read as a black fill, it won't read at favicon size.
3. **Exaggerate ONE feature** — The breakout element (big ears, long tail, unusual crest) IS the character's identity.
4. **Map traits to visuals explicitly** — Don't hope personality comes through. Design it in with specific visual correlates.
5. **Budget colors ruthlessly** — 3-5 max. Every additional color weakens recognition.
6. **The default pose IS the character** — If the resting state doesn't tell you who this is, no animation will save it.
7. **Use as quality gate** — Apply this checklist to concepts from ANY designer lens before finalizing.
