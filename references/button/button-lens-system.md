<section name="overview">

The five designer lenses influence how illustrated buttons feel — their personality, visual treatment, and emotional register. Each lens shapes the illustration component while respecting button fundamentals (label clarity, state design, touch targets).

Agent A always applies the Raroque lens. Agents B and C apply contrasting lenses. All agents apply Eggleston fundamentals as quality gate.

**Chris Raroque — Warmth Buttons**

Buttons feel crafted with care. The illustration adds a personal, handmade quality that makes functional actions feel delightful.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Illustration style | Soft, rounded accents — a small creature peek, a warm glow, a gentle curve |
| Color | Warm accent (#F59E0B range) on the illustration element |
| State: hover | Illustration brightens subtly — like it noticed you |
| State: pressed | Gentle squish — the illustration responds to touch |
| State: disabled | Illustration dims and rests — present but inactive |
| Personality | "This button was made with care for you specifically" |

**Greg Hartman — Systems Buttons**

Buttons as UI components with character states. The illustration is systematic — defined states, consistent behavior, animation-ready.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Illustration style | Geometric mascot elements — eyes, expressions, shape language accents |
| Color | Systematic — one accent applied consistently across all illustrated buttons |
| State: hover | Character element shifts to alert/engaged expression |
| State: pressed | Quick squash-and-stretch — designed for animation |
| State: disabled | Character element shows sleeping/inactive state |
| Personality | "This button is a component in a character system" |

**Healing Character — Gentle Buttons**

Buttons that don't demand attention. The illustration is so subtle it's almost not there — a soft presence rather than a visual shout.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Illustration style | Minimal, almost abstract — a soft shape, a gentle curve, breathing room |
| Color | Desaturated, warm — cream, soft brown, pale pink |
| State: hover | Almost no change — maybe a slight warmth increase |
| State: pressed | Gentle, slow response — nothing snappy or energetic |
| State: disabled | Illustration fades to near-invisible — was it ever there? |
| Personality | "This button is here when you need it, not demanding anything" |

<section name="burnt_toast_lens_buttons">

**Burnt Toast — Personality Buttons**

Buttons with attitude. The illustration has an opinion about the action — a quirky character reaction that makes the interaction memorable.

| Aspect | Application |
|--------|------------|
| Illustration style | Bold geometric character element with one unexpected detail |
| Color | Pastel accent on the personality element — muted container |
| State: hover | Character element reacts — side-eye, eyebrow raise, slight lean |
| State: pressed | Character element has an opinion — nod, shrug, thumbs up |
| State: disabled | Character element is bored — eyes closed, turned away |
| Personality | "This button has feelings about what you're about to do" |

**Brookes Eggleston — Button Quality Gate**

Applied to ALL button concepts regardless of lens.

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|------------|
| Label primacy | Label readable and primary — illustration doesn't compete |
| Shape language | Illustration's shape matches the button's emotional intent |
| State clarity | All 5 states (default, hover, pressed, disabled, loading) designed |
| Size appropriate | Illustration complexity matches the button tier |
| Color budget | Within tier limit (1-5 colors depending on tier) |
| Accessibility | Label sufficient for screen readers, contrast met, touch target met |
| Set cohesion | All illustrated buttons in the app share style and personality |

Any concept that fails 2+ checks needs refinement before proceeding.
